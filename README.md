Project's goal is to create two executable files: <br>
**Assembler:** it translate a given assembly code to a binary file, where each line is an instruction. <br>
**Simulator:** it takes the binary file and executes each line within the file.
<br>
<br>
**Usage:** 1) Open cmd/terminal and navigate to one of 4 files (binom, sort, triangle, disktest) <br>
           2) execute assembler by typing: asm.exe (assembly file name).asm memin.txt -> it will generate a file called memin.txt <br>
           3) execute simulator by typing: sim.exe memin.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt memout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv
