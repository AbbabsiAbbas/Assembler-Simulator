# Assembly to Binary Translator and Simulator

This project aims to create two executable files: an Assembler and a Simulator. The Assembler translates a given assembly code into a binary file, where each line represents an instruction. The Simulator then takes the binary file and executes each line within it.

## Project Overview

### Assembler
The Assembler is responsible for translating assembly language code into a binary format. The output is a binary file (`memin.txt`) where each line corresponds to a single instruction from the assembly code.

### Simulator
The Simulator reads the binary file generated by the Assembler and executes the instructions line by line. The Simulator interacts with various input and output files to simulate a complete system environment.

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Assembly Files
Ensure you have one of the provided assembly files (`binom.asm`, `sort.asm`, `triangle.asm`, `disktest.asm`) ready.

### Step 2: Run the Assembler
Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory containing your assembly file, and run the Assembler using the following command:

```bash
asm.exe <assembly_file>.asm memin.txt
```
### Step 3: Run the Simulator
Once the memin.txt file is created, you can execute the Simulator with the following command:

```bash
sim.exe memin.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt memout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv

```

Input Files:
memin.txt: The binary file generated by the Assembler.
diskin.txt: Input file representing the disk data.
irq2in.txt: Input file for interrupt requests.
Output Files:
memout.txt: Memory output after execution.
regout.txt: Register output after execution.
trace.txt: Trace of executed instructions.
hwregtrace.txt: Trace of hardware register changes.
cycles.txt: Number of cycles executed.
leds.txt: LED output state.
display7seg.txt: 7-segment display output.
diskout.txt: Disk data output.
monitor.txt: Monitor output data.
monitor.yuv: YUV file for video monitor output.
